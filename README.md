✅ EdgeAppSwitcher

EdgeAppSwitcher is a lightweight Windows utility built with AutoHotkey that lets you switch between open applications by moving your mouse to the left or right edge of the screen.
Instead of using Alt+Tab, you can simply move your cursor to the screen edge to cycle through your open apps. The trigger zones, delays, and behavior are fully configurable, and a visual guide overlay helps you fine-tune the active areas.
This tool is designed for users who work with many windows and want a faster, more natural way to switch between them.
